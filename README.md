# SDC310-Shop

Minimal PHP shop app for SDC310 course.

Run locally with PHP built-in server:

```bash
cd Week2Shop
composer install
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

Or with XAMPP: set DocumentRoot to `.../Week2Shop/public` and restart Apache.

Import `sql/schema.sql` into MySQL to create tables, then `sql/seed.sql` to populate demo data.
